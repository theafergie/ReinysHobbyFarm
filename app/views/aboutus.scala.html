<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p> Nestled in the heart of Central Arkansas, we are a family owned, small-scale hobby farm focusing on fresh, pure ingredients.
At Ashley's Jammin' Jellies, we strive for high quality jams, jellies and butters using only fresh, in season, local produce.
    On our 2-acre farm, we currently grow a variety of berries including blueberries, blackberries and scuppernongs.
    We have a raised bed garden where jalape√±os, tomatoes, rhubarb and herbs are grown to be used in our canned goods.
    We plan to add muscadines, apple trees and red honeysuckle in the seasons to come. We love picking strawberries, peaches and apples
    and supporting our favorite local orchard.

    We are current members of the Downtown Conway Farmers' and Crafts Market which runs from May through October. At our
    stand you can expect a wide variety of high quality, delicious jams, jellies and butters featuring our most popular,
    Honeysuckle-Strawberry Jelly with occasional produce from our garden. We also have a line of natural products using
    high-grade essential oils from beard oil and balm to roll-ons and sprays.
</p>
<p><h3>WHO IS REINY?</h3>
Our farm is named after a colt that was born on our very rainy wedding day. Thus, "Reiny" is not just a beautiful
gelding, he is our family, our boy.
